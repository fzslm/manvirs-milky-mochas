# manvir's milky mochas

*sighs*

this one is gonna need a little bit of backstory.


## the story behind the masterpiece
so, back in like year 13 (ppl aged 17 - 18, for you trans-atlantic cunts) there was a joke kicking about that one of my friends was a sexual predator or whatever. i know, it was crude, but it was a holdover from when we were like thirteen. (p.s. i'm not much funnier these days either.)

now as a "nice" gesture, i decided to immortalise some of my friends into this game as, yknow in a couple years time i'd probably look at it and think "awwh what a nice little souvenir from that time frame isn't that nice". fair enough, i thought.  i wanted to make a game where you'd start your own coffee shop and work your way up by buying furniture n shit from money you made making coffee. it'd have multiplayer and a friends system and basically it was just another free-2-play money grabbing scheme.

BUT

then i put two and two together (it only took me four months of planning!) and i decided that instead of one of my friends being a coach to run you through building your coffee shop (cause she really liked coffee, so i thought it was fitting) i decided to use my sexual predator friend (note: not actually a sexual predator, pls no report) and base the game around him. this'd lead to all sorts of fun innuendos, i thought! like instead of there being actual cows milk in the coffee, you'd milk his... eh, i'm too ashamed of myself to continue.

so yeah, that's how this abomination came to be. i couldn't be arsed to add multiplayer or even finish the game, so here it is in its pure shittiness. somehow i got a B from this so fuck i ain't complaining

# BUGS
there are too many to mention them all, but here are a few of my faves!

* font isn't right on non-Macs. a consequence of me neglecting to properly test on windows. as a result, it uses times new roman and looks like utter wank
* sometimes if you have two items of the same type within proximity, moving one actually ends up moving the other.
* after completing tutorial, no customers actually appear, so there's no way to actually progress in the game. oops!
* there's no title bar. i was meant to make my own, but didn't.
* after completing the minigame sequence (which will never happen unless you manually invoke it using the command interface), holding ENTER will cause the game to infinitely refresh. i guess i never had a chance to test that because there was never a way to actually complete the minigame sequence outside the tutorial!
* customers *always* like their coffee. i was too lazy to fix that.
* some of the speech from Manvir isn't actually finished. (example: "You only have $MONEY?" or "Nice work, $NAME!") i didn't notice until it was submitted. fuuuuuuu*ck*
* you can scroll the game while an NPC is talking. this causes visual disturbances.
* clicking the tray button too fast can cause the wrong glyph to show (i.e. showing the hide button even if the item tray is already hidden.)
* after an NPC is done talking, the items in the background flicker.
* if you actually manage to summon a customer, the customer button that you click to summon one doesn't actually hide itself. this means that if you want to generate a different order (perhaps an easier one) you can just click it again. *boooooooo*
* restarting the tutorial at a certain point can cause the game to be stuck in the tutorial (i.e. further progress becomes impossible.)

*phew* that's not even all of them. note that i was aware of pretty much all of these, i just couldn't be fucked to fix them. go me!
